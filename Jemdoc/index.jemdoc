== About Me
I received a B.S. degree in mathematics from [http://english.pku.edu.cn/  Peking University (PKU)], in 2020. My undergraduate supervisor is [http://dsec.pku.edu.cn/~rli/ Prof. Ruo Li]. \n
My graduate supervisor will be [http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~hou/ Prof. Thomas Yizhao Hou]. \n
I will matriculate remotely in Caltech and join [http://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/ BICMR] as a research assistant hosted by Prof. Ruo Li and [http://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~zhennan/ Prof. Zhennan Zhou] at Fall 2020.

== Research
My research interests broadly lie in 
- Numerical Analysis   
- Partial Differential Equation
- Applied Probability

Actively looking for discussions and possible collaborations on interesting topics.
